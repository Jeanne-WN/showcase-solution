Running end-to-end tests can present challenges, such as the long duration of the running process, the flakiness of some tests and the challenges of fixing failures in CI when running tests in headless mode. Our teams have had very good experiences with [**Cypress**](http://www.cypress.io/) by solving common issues such as lack of performance and long wait time for responses and resources to load. Cypress is a useful tool that helps developers build end-to-end tests and records all test steps as a video in an MP4 file to make it easier to identify errors.
